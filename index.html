    <h1>Tracy Resume Project Retrospective</h1>
    <h2>Overall</h2>
    <p>It was satisfying to finally get my resume in web page form. Previously, it was only available as a Word document or on websites such as LinkedIn and SEEK.</p>
    <h2>1) What went well? </h2>
    <p>Using the different alignment methods such as grid and flexbox worked well on the appearance of the Work Experience and Education sections. Adding the background image via CSS also improved the appearance and provided context of the Education section rather than having text on a solid background. The comments worked well to assist finding sections in the HTML which had become quite long.</p>
    <h2>2) What could have been improved?</h2>
    <p>The text towards the bottom of the Education section is hard to see against the background image. This could be improved by experimenting with different values for background-size and background position in the .education selector in the CSS file. I had previously experimented with padding but this wasn't producing the desired effect, maybe because I had set box sizing at the top of the CSS to be inherited by all elements.</p>
    <p>I also would like to add responsive code so that the content alignment readjusts for smaller screens such as mobile. Currently, the number of columns in the work experience and education sections are static. I would like to add code that readjusts to one column on smaller screens/viewports.</p>
    <h2>3) The key take aways.</h2>
    <p>After working through the CSS labs and project, I have experienced and can appreciate that practicing CSS is the best way to become really proficient at it. Overall, the creativity side of CSS was quite enjoyable. I also feel that, with practice, I can work on better communicating my code. I think I did an ok job in my video walkthough, but there is defnitely room for improvement. I appreciate this would be an essential skill in any professional setting.</p>
    <h2>4) The process I followed</h2>
    <p>First I added all the content and sections to my HTML. Then I started the styling in CSS. I then went back to some parts of the HTML to add 'content wrappers' so I could target specific sections with CSS. I also did a lot of checking the actual appearance of the web page as I worked through the CSS and adjusted where necessary.</p>
